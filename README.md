About:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Document Notarization System is a blockchain-based solution developed to address the inefficiencies and security flaws of traditional notarization methods. By utilizing Ethereum smart contracts and cryptographic hashing (SHA-256), the system allows users to notarize documents by storing their hash, the notary's address, and a timestamp on the blockchain. This approach ensures transparency, immutability, and eliminates the need for centralized authorities. Built using tools like Remix IDE and MetaMask, the system enables real-time, tamper-proof verification while preserving privacy by avoiding storage of the actual document. It is cost-effective for both development and deployment and offers future scalability through integration with IPFS, role-based access, and legal compliance. The project demonstrates the practical application of blockchain technology in secure digital document verification.
